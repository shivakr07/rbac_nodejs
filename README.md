# Role Based Access Control Application

This is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Passport.js**. It serves as a starting point for any project that requires **authentication** and **authorization**.  

## Features
- **Authentication** using Email and Password.
- Easily extendable to support OAuth/OAuth2.0 (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub, Apple).
- Based on the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern.
- Uses **Mongoose** as an ORM for **MongoDB**.
- **Passport.js** for local authentication.
- Production-ready setup.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** installed on your system.
- **MongoDB** installed and running.
